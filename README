Arduino Z-code Interpreter Program

This version of the Z-code interpreter is derived from Jzip created by John Holder.
More information about Jzip, including the source code can by found here:
http://jzip.sourceforge.net/

Updated by @talofer99 to 2021 compatibility: 
  -sd init added the #define SD_CONFIG SdSpiConfig(SD_CS_PIN, DEDICATED_SPI)
  -updates the PROGMEM issue to const char
  -SdFatUtil.h need to go into folder /libraries/SdFat-master/src/
  

Updated by @AeroSigma to 2017 compatibility:
  -SdFatUtil sourced and added since no longer part of greiman's SdFat library (see S/W dependencies below.)
  -Card initialization updated to modern format: SdFat.begin(chipSelect,SPI_SPEED), instead of SdFat.init(SPI_SPEED,chipSelect)
  -SRANDOM_FUNC and RANDOM_FUNC defined to modern srand and rand.
  -Added if def to use USB serial on Cortex M0 chips (e.g. Adafruit Feather M0)
  

Software Dependencies:
SDFAT library: https://github.com/greiman/SdFat
SdFatUtil.h: Copy from here: https://github.com/adafruit/SD, into SDFat Library under new folder .../libraries/SdFat-master/src/util

Hardware Dependencies:
Formatted SD card
I am using the SD card interface on the Adafruit Feather M0 Datalogger

Getting Started Steps:
1. Copy a Z-Machine game file to the SD card and name it "GAME.DAT".
2. Compile and upload the sketch to the Arduino.
3. Open the Arduino Serial Monitor, set the baud rate to 115200 (or your choice in azip.ino line 33) and the line ending to Newline.
4. The sketch will pause waiting for the return key.
5. After hitting the return key, within a few seconds you should see the welcome screen in the serial monitor.
6. You can begin typing commands in the top portion of the serial monitor, next to the Send button.

I have include a copy Mini-Zork I downloaded from here:
http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXinfocomXdemos.html

Game files can be found several places on the internet, a good source for games is The Interactive Fiction Archive:

Zork I, II, and III can be downloaded here:

Limitations:
Due to the limits of RAM and FLASH, I removed most of the screen handling capability. 
I removed the game save and restore capability. I will continue to see if I can add some basic game save/restore capability.
